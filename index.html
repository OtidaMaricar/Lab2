			<h1> FRUIT SALAD </h1>
				<p> Fruit Salad is a general term referring to a fruit dish. This dish is typically composed of <br>
				an assortment of fruits served as is or combined with different types of sweet liquid and <br>
				table cream. This can either be served as an appetizer, a side dish, and as a dessert.In the <br>
				Philippines, fruit salad is considered to be more of a dessert rather than an appetizer or side <br>
				dish. The Filipino version of the fruit salad requires the use of condensed milk and table <br>
				cream which makes the dish rich and sweet. </p>
				
				<p> The typical Filipino fruit salad is composed of canned fruit cocktail combined with condensed <br>
				milk and table cream. However, there are also some versions wherein buko or young coconut is <br>
				added (this should not be mistaken as the buko salad wherein young coconut is exclusively used). </p>

				<p> This Fruit Salad Recipe makes use of the typical Filipino fruit salad ingredients with the <br>
				addition of other fruits that are in season. Besides the canned fruit cocktail, nata de coco, <br>
				fresh strawberries, fresh blueberries, and kiwi were also added. </p>

				<p> I’m pretty sure that you have your own fruit salad version. How do you make your fruit <br>
				salad? What are the fruits that you regularly use? Your opinion matters; hope to hear from you. </p>
